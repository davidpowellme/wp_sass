#Experimenting with using Sass and WP
This is an experimental repo where I try to incorporate Sass and WP. It's also an experiment in local WP development.

Currently following an article by Elegant Themes:
[https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-use-sass-with-wordpress-a-step-by-step-guide](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/tips-tricks/how-to-use-sass-with-wordpress-a-step-by-step-guide)

I'll be experimenting on a site for a client (don't worry, I'm not charging them for the time I spend learning). The current site [aboutrecords.com](http://aboutrecords.com), which I currently have taken down, but you can go to the Wayback Machine and see what I'm working with.

As inspiration, I'm using the following sites/pages:

[Atlantic Records - Roster Page](http://www.atlanticrecords.com/artists)  
[Bright Antenna - Artist Page](http://www.brightantenna.com/artists-master/the-wombats)
[Run for Cover - Homepage](http://www.runforcoverrecords.com/)
[DefJam - Homepage](http://www.defjam.com/)

##Step 1 - Install MAMP and WP
MAMP is being a bitch. At first it wouldn't download. Now it won't verify.

##Alt Step 1 - Install Cyberduck
I'm hypothesizing that I can creating Sass partials, turn on Sass watch, and potentially write Sass after accessing FTP.

That might not be true, but I can write vanilla CSS and still be happy using FTP.
